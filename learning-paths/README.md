There are different _paths_ that maybe should be traveled in parallel:
- learning a new technology (a new language, framework, library, DevOps tool, etc.)
- learning more fundamentals (networking, hardware, computer systems, CodeCrafters work to rebuild existing tech from scratch, etc.)
- learning good SWE practice (TDD, BDD, DDD, design patterns, software architecture, formal diagrams, processes i.e. SAFe and Kanban, etc.)
- domain specifics (based on your industry)
- professional development

TODO: Map these on an actual mind map to start making it visual!

Some sources for coming up with a list of possible next resources:

- [x] Amazon wishlist
- [x] Free programming books github repo
- [ ] Humble Bundle books on Dropbox
- [ ] Udemy Library/Wishlist
- [ ] Physical Books
- [ ] Audible library
- [ ] Audible wishlist
NOTE: I've already gone through the default Wishlist on Amazon.

When picking up a new resource:
First decide on the topic you most want to learn next on that path
Then, Google for more updated resources than what you have listed
Then, compare what turns up in results with what you have listed for that topic and pick a resource
Make sure you're using the latest edition of whatever book you're using, if it's a book
As you study the topic, with each new thing you learn, continually go back to the big picture and fit that piece of knowledge into it, even by literally drawing a big-picture mind map and visualizing or writing where it fits in the mind map
When done, move resource to Completed and re-order topics in To Do list
