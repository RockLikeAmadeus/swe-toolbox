There are different _paths_ that maybe should be traveled in parallel:
- learning a new technology (a new language, framework, library, DevOps tool, etc.)
- learning more fundamentals (networking, hardware, computer systems, CodeCrafters work to rebuild existing tech from scratch, etc.)
- learning good SWE practice (TDD, BDD, DDD, design patterns, software architecture, formal diagrams, processes i.e. SAFe and Kanban, etc.)
- domain specifics (based on your industry)
