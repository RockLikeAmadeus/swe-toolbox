- Best practices
  - Two ways to create reusable objected: Scenes and Scripts.
    - Neither are actually classes, but good idea to use OOP principles when thinking about them.
      - "The scene is always an extension of the script attached to its root node, so you can interpret it as part of a class. Most of the techniques explained in this best practices series build on this point."
      - Come back to this first page in the Best Practices section after going through the rest, to see if it makes more sense.
  - Scene organization

I'm getting confused. Go [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html) and do a tutorial first.
