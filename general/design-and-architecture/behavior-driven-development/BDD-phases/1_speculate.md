# Start with business goals

Before thinking about individual features of your software, you must get clear about what problems you're trying to solve and what business value you're trying to deliver. If the features we decide to build aren't derived from that, there's a great chance we're wasting our time by building the wrong thing.

The reason this phase is called "speculate" is to remind us that the value of the features we plan on developing is not guaranteed in advance. Instead, it's more like a hypothesis or bet that the feature will deliver the business value we intend for it. Developing features one at a time and then validating their value also gives us a chance to learn and better understand the problem domain. Later, in the validate phase, we'll examine the metrics that are produced from our experiment and feed them into the next speculate phase.

We begin with Strategic Planning, where we transform business opportunities or challenges into a prioritized list of features.

## Strategic Planning

In a convention team structure, the strategic planning work involves all stakeholders, from high-level strategic decision makers to the individual contributors who will implement the features. This planning happens continuously throughout the project, rather than all at once at the beginning of the project (think agile approach rather than waterfall).

## Describing vision and goals for the business

This part involves the top two sections of [this pyramid](../_index.md#from-vision-to-executable-specification).

It's best to start with a _vision statement_.  A good vision statement will be simple, clear, and concise, and will focus on the project's objectives, _not_ on how it will deliver those objectives. A useful template follows:

```
FOR <target customer>
WHO <needs something>
THE <product name> is a <product category>
THAT <key benefit, compelling reason to buy>
UNLIKE <primary competitive alternative>
OUR PRODUCT <statement of primary differentiation>
```

For example:

```
FOR travelers
WHO want to be rewarded for traveling with Flying High Airlines
THE Flying High Frequent Flyer program IS A loyalty program
THAT lets members easily and conveniently view and manage their accumulated 
 points in real time, and spend their points for real purchases with 
 unequaled ease.
UNLIKE other airline Frequent Flyer programs,
OUR PRODUCT lets members use their points easily for any sort of online or 
 brick-and-mortar purchase.
