# Start with business goals

Before thinking about individual features of your software, you must get clear about what problems you're trying to solve and what business value you're trying to deliver. If the features we decide to build aren't derived from that, there's a great chance we're wasting our time by building the wrong thing.

We begin with Strategic Planning, where we transform business opportunities or challenges into a prioritized list of features.

## Strategic Planning

In a convention team structure, the strategic planning work involves all stakeholders, from high-level strategic decision makers to the individual contributors who will implement the features.
