# High-Level End-to-End BDD Example

The process essentially has a 6-step cycle:

![alt text](BDD-activities.png)

1. [Speculate](#speculate-identifying-business-values-and-features): Identify high-level business goals and key features for achieving them
2. [Illustrate](): Get concrete about a specific feature using examples
3. [Formulate](): Transform examples into executable specifications
4. [Automate](): Transform executable specifications into automated acceptance tests
5. [Demonstrate](): Show that the feature does what it is supposed to do
6. [Validate](): Observe how the feature behaves in the real world

This example describes the process of building an application for a public transport department which provides train timetable data and rel-time updates about delays, track work, etc.

## Speculate: Identifying business values and features

### 1. Identify business objectives

Identify the business problem we're solving. In this case, at a high level, we want to build an application that makes it easier for commuters to plan their commutes. But we want to get more specific than that, so we'll state the project vision as such:

"The application will help to reduce average travel time for regular commuters by 10% within a year, by allowing them to plan their journeys more effectively.‚Äù
