Once you have a high-level initial design (it won't be the final design and that's OK):

- The first step is to locally set up all of the projects that represent components of your system with essentially no functionality. Your end-to-end test should run and pass locally.
- The second step is to get a working manual deployment in place, functioning end-to-end?
- The third step is to set up a build->test->deploy pipeline through source control?
