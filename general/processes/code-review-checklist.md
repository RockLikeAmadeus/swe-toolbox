- ## Use this checklist on your own code before opening a PR
- ### Principles of Clean Code
	- Does one thing well
	- Should read like well-written prose
	- Has strong attention to detail
	- Is "pretty much what you'd expect"
	- Clarity is kind
- # Checklist
	- ## General
		- [ ] Document comments on methods should have parameter descriptions filled out for every added public method and property
		- [ ] Unit tests exist for any interfaces that were developed
		- [ ] Unit tests do not test the implementation details of the concrete types that implement new interfaces
		- [ ] Code is as small as can be, is not unnecessarily bulky
		- [ ] Code contains no _true_ diplication (and makes no attempt to avoid accidental duplication; that is, when there is similar code that has a reasonable possibility to diverge in the future)
		- [ ] Placeholder task for doing a google search for code review tasks to fill in any blanks or add any other good ideas for things to look for
	- ## Names (Variables, Functions, Arguments, Classes, Files, Directories)
		- [ ] Names reveal intent (if a name requires a comment to understand, maybe it should have a more descriptive name)
		- [ ] Names are descriptive about their significance (`List1` is not explicit)
		- [ ] Names include units, if applicable
		- [ ] Acronyms are used carefully without likelihood of generating confusion
		- [ ] Names with broad scopes are long enough to be searchable (a variable called `e` is basically impossible to search for); the broader the scope, the longer the name
		- [ ] Method names are verbs or verb phrases
		- [ ] Property and variable names, as well as class and object names, are nouns or noun phrases
			- [ ] Class names avoid "noise" words such as `Data`, `Info`, or `Details`
		- [ ] The code does not force the reader to mentally map a meaningless variable name to the actual concept to which it refers
		- [ ] Code has one word per abstract concept (i.e. doesn't use "fetch", "retrieve", and "get" simultaneously and inconsistently)
	- ## Functions
		- [ ] Functions should be small (extract into sub-functions where appropriate)
			- How small? Single-digit lines if possible
		- [ ] Function calls within blocks should add documentary value by having descriptive names
		- [ ] Indent level for functions should be no more than one or two
		- [ ] Switch statements are replaced with polymorphism (bury the switch statement in the basement of an abstract factory)
		- [ ] Functions should have as few arguments as possible, using techniques such as
			- Instance variables
			- Wrapping multiple parameters that describe a related concept into a class isn't cheating
		- [ ] Output arguments are avoided
		- [ ] "Flag" parameters are avoided (functions with boolean flags do two things, by definition)
		- [ ] Embed argument names into functions, when helpful
		- [ ] Functions do not have side effects (they do only what the name of the function says they do)
			- Functions should "do" something or "answer" something, but not both!
