Always be learning. Why? Because everything is constantly changing? That's one reason (and a good one). But if the state of software engineering were frozen in time from this day forward, there would still be more to learn than could be learned in a lifetime. Being a software engineer means understanding the inner workings of, and being able to build, fix, modify, and extend the most complex machines humans have ever conceived. Doing so _well_ without dedicating yourself to improving your understanding of the bodies of knowledge upon which the discipline is built is a fantasy.

Understanding what those relevant bodies of knowledge _are_ is step one.

# Aspects of Software Engineering

Note: even where I have not explicitly listed it, all concepts are broken into two parts: the first is the ideas and the abstractions that comprise a concept; the second are the specific implementations of those abstractions that we have to deal with as engineers. For example, it is important to understand _cloud computing_ in general, but that knowledge is usually not much use without an understanding of the specific _cloud computing platform_ you'll need to use, such as AWS or GCP. Furthermore, you'll want to understand the ideas behind processor architecture, but you might also want to study, for instance, the x86 instruction set specificially.
