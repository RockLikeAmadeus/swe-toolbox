# What language do I need right now?

## Python

Python is a good alternative to shell scripts or batch files for more complex automation tasks--it provides a lot of the same functionality and ease of use, but is a more fully functional and ergonomic programming language.

Also, Python defines the [socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) library which provides "a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system call and library interface for sockets to Pythonâ€™s object-oriented style", making it a common choice for network programming when we don't want to work at a higher level than raw C demands.

And, of course, Python is ideal for data science tasks.
