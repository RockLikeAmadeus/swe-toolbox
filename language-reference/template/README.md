# What makes <language> unique?

_What are a couple of the most important high-level things to be aware of that make this language what it is? What features and quirks define the language and must be kept in mind at (pretty much) all times? Note: this section is not for notes on unique syntax--that section is below. Delete this block once the reference for this language is "complete"_

# What do I need installed to write <language> code

_A couple quick notes on what should be installed, i.e. compilers, interpreters, package managers, common workflow tools, etc... Include notes on specific language/compiler versions if appropriate. Delete this block once the reference for this language is "complete"_

# FOR INTERPRETED LANGUAGES ONLY I want to execute simple commands in the REPL

# I just want to write a quick script with <language>

_Notes on writing and then running a standalone script or small process here. Include the simplest way to retrieve command line arguments. Delete this block once the reference for this language is "complete"_

# I'm starting a new software project with <language>

_Notes on the structure and terminology of more complex, multi-file projects here. Talk about how code is organized in <language>, how files are named, common patterns for specific types of projects, and tools commonly used for scaffolding new projects. Keep it brief, and leave the details to [this page I haven't created yet]. Delete this block once the reference for this language is "complete"_

# Syntax and Style

## Essential Syntax and Style

_Examples of the most important syntax and style to know without having to go all the way to external resources.
Also include the most notable syntax-related things to know about that make this language different than other languages. Delete this block once the reference for this language is "complete"_

## Comprehensive Syntax and Style

_Links to relevant example syntax and style guides, like learnxinyminutes.com, or official style guides. Delete this block once the reference for this language is "complete"_

## Documenting <Language> Code

_What is the idiomatic way to document your code, especially any public API it might expose? What other details are relevant to documentation?_

[Contents](#contents)

# Basics of Testing

_What are the basics of automated tests for this language? If testing isn't built into the language, what testing frameworks are most popular? What is the basic syntax for writing automated tests, and how are test functions and files organized?_

[Contents](#contents)

# Useful Library Imports

_What are the most commonly included libraries, preferably from the language's standard library? Specify the syntax for including them, what each library is used for, and optionally, a link to the libraries documentation page._

[Contents](#contents)

# Essential Language Toolset Commands

_What commands with the languages compiler and/or included workflow command-line tools should be known, or at least be known of?_

[Contents](#contents)

# Tools

_What are some well-known and widely-used third party tools and frameworks that it's important to be aware of, such as CLI or TUI frameworks, or web frameworks? Be sure to include what they're used for and maybe some well established pros, cons, and use cases._

[Contents](#contents)

# Utilities

_What are some well-known and widely-used third party libraries that it's important to be aware of, such as logging, financial libraries, math libraries, or data structure utilities? Be sure to include what they're used for and maybe some well established pros, cons, and use cases._

# How To

_Define an organized list, with subheadings as appropriate, of links to pages in this reference *OR* to a project or file that serves as an example, of patterns or processes for which it would be beneficial to have a reference for demonstration. There is no reason two or more links cannot point to the same example, particularly when multiple patterns are represented in a single example project or file._
