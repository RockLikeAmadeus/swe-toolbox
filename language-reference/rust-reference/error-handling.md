# Recoverable Errors

# Unrecoverable Errors

Unrecoverable errors are always a symptom of a bug. Panics occur either by performing an action that causes Rust to panic, or explicitly calling the `panic!` macro.

```rs
fn main() {
    panic!("crash and burn");
}
```

### Backtracing to debug a panic

```rs
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    v[99]; // panic!
}
```

Set backtracing on by setting the environment variable `RUST_BACKTRACE` to any value (except 0), assuming not building for release.

```
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99', src/main.rs:4:5
