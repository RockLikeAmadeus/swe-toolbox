Go **Modules** are composed of **Packages**. Go **Packages** are just directories of `.go` files. So, this project (Go Reference) is composed of a small package for each chapter of the LGWT book.

To create a new Go module (project), navigate to the directory that you want to be the project root, and run `$ go mod init`.

The `main()` function in Go is the entry point of executable applications.

Try `$ go help mod`
