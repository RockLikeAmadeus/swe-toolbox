# Basic Syntax

```js
```

See more details syntax [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/javascript/)

# Code Structure and Organization

Code structure and organization depends entirely on whether this is _browser-based_ JavaScript or _Node_ JavaScript.

## Browser-Based JavaScript

In the `<head>` or even the `<body>` section of your HTML page, you might put:

```html
<script src="assets/scripts/app.js" type="module"></script>
```

By specifying your JavaScript file as a `module`, you can use the modern `import` and `export` syntax.
