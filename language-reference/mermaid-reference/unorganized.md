# Dependency Diagram

I think this can be implemented using Mermaid's [_state diagram_](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/stateDiagram.html) or the [_entity relationship diagram_](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html).

The state diagram is much simpler and probably works for most use cases.
