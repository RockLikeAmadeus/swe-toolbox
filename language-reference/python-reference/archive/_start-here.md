# Which Version Should I Use?

Just use Python 3 unless you're working on old code.

# Code Organization

Python code is made up of packages which are made up of modules.

Modules are just Python files, the things that get imported with `import`.

Packages are directories containing one or more `.py` files and a `__init__.py` file, which is often empty.

# Running Code

Run the interpreter with `$ python` or, for more features, `$ ipython`.

Run scripts with `$ python main.py`

# Installing, Updating, Package Management

For most purposes, I think `conda` is probably sufficient (I installed `miniconda`) rather than `pip`, though you may need both. `conda` has `virtualenv` features built in.
