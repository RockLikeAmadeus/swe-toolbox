# What makes <language> unique?

What are a couple of the most important high-level things to be aware of that make this language what it is? What features and quirks define the language and must be kept in mind at (pretty much) all times?

# What do I need installed to write Python code

Rather than installing `pip` and then needing to install `virtualenv`, install [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), which includes both and simplifies things, even though it's a good deal more than just a Python package manager. Most likely you want to use [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/), as the full anaconda version is bloated with packages you likely won't use and can be added later if needed. Don't skip the "Verify your install" step. On Windows, Anaconda has a dedicated terminal "Anaconda Prompt".

From Conda, run `pip install ipython` for a more feature-full Python interpreter.

When it comes to which version of Python to use (2 or 3), just use Python 3 unless you're explicitly working on a legacy Python 2 codebase. That's the default behavior with Anaconda, anyway.

# I want to execute simple commands in the REPL. 

# I just want to write a quick script with <language>

Notes on writing and then running a standalone script or small process here.

# I'm starting a new software project with <language>

Notes on the structure and terminology of more complex, multi-file projects here. Talk about how code is organized in <language>, how files are named, common patterns for specific types of projects, and tools commonly used for scaffolding new projects. Keep it brief, and leave the details to [this page I haven't created yet].
