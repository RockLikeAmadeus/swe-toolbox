Parallel circuits are _current dividing_, meaning the current is split among each parallel path/leg of the circuit, but the voltage drop across each must be the same.

Series circuits are _voltage dividing_, meaning the total voltage drop across multiple components in series is the sum of the voltage drop across each component, but the current through each component must be the same.
