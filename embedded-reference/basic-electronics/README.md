# Basics

By convention, use a **_red_** wire to denote the fixed-high (i.e 5V) supply, and a **_black_** wire to denote the ground (0V) connection of the circuit. Different colors should be used for variable outputs, like the connections to DIO pins.

## Inputs/Sensors

### Digital Inputs

### Analog Inputs

Remember: the analog input pins measure the _voltage drops_ across the contained circuit. Analog sensors will vary their properties based on their environment, but the property that varies will rarely be as straightforward as the voltage. For instance, it is the _resistance_ of a photoresistor that varies with light. That means you will often need to cleverly design a circuit that converts the information provided by the sensor into **a voltage drop between the analog input pin and ground**.
